			<h2>SVA</h2>
			<p>The Student Veterans of America Organization (SVA), is a nationally known Organization comprised of many Student Veteran run chapters across the country.  Founded in 2008, the organization has expanded to 
				chapters many chapters around the country.  This new organization helped push the Post 9/11 G.I. Bill into law.  
				These chapters are dedicated to community service, Veteran mental health and well-being, community, and advocation of policy to improve the quality of life for 
				Veterans on campus.  Every year, in early January, there is a National Conference (NatCon) held in either Texas, California (LA), or Florida (Disney).  At this conference,
				many chapters around the country gather to sit in lectures or panels on things like leadership, running a student organization, the job hiring process, and advocacy for Veterans.
				There are also guest speakers and awards for Veteran of the Year, Chapter of the Year, etc.

			<h2>Oakland University Chapter</h2>
			<p>At Oakland University, I was part of the Student Veterans of America at that University.  During that time, we put on events such as Veterans' Week, worked with other outside organizations
			to help with their events, and attended the National Conference in Los Angeles.  We also, as an organization, assisted in putting on a Veterans Week on campus by working with the Veterans Support Services office
			in planning and hosting events each day of the week.  I also was in charge of hosting minor events, such as Top Golf and Bowling.

			<h2>University of Michigan Chapter</h2>
			<p>At the University of Michigan, I was also a part of the Student Veterans of America organization.  Each week, our student organization puts on classes at meetings to teach about finances, health, and other issues that are
				important to Veterans.  We also host events for Veterans to relax and have fun such as axe throwing and whirlyball.  On top of these minor events, we also put on one major event each year which is our Benefit Dinner.
				This involves gathering donors for a silent auction in which we raise funds for a service organization such as Guardian Angels Service Dogs.  We also attend NATCON (National Conference) as an organization.
